        <h1> Introduction to Rap </h1>
        <p> The 1990s were one of the defining eras of rap music. During this decade, rap grew more powerful, more expressive, and more influential. Artists created unforgettable lyrics that captured the realities and the attitudes of the time. Many new styles also rose such as gangsta rap, conscious rap, and alternative rap, each showcasing their own sound and message. The decade was also fueled by the East and West coast rivalry, shaping and influencing the rap scene. </p>
