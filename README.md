<h4> Description: </h4>

<p> This website aims to introduce individuals to the genres of r&b and rap from the 2000s, otherwise called the y2k. These genres were chosen because these are the genres we personally enjoy listening to. Their nostalgic vibe and unique sound inspired us to explore and share more about this era of music. Our website features various artists from each genre and allows user to discover their music.  </p>
